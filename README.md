<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 DB_Vet_Clinic <a name="about-project"></a>


In this project, the objective is to develop a comprehensive database for a veterinary clinic aimed at effectively managing crucial information about animals. The tasks encompass designing and implementing tables using SQL, seamlessly incorporating data entries, and executing diverse queries for information retrieval. The ultimate aim is to forge a meticulously organized database, thereby fostering practical proficiency in handling data within the framework of a relational database system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

## Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/ClaudiaRojasSoto/DB_Vet_Clinic.git

```

2. Set up a PostgreSQL database named vet_clinic.


## Database Structure
The `schema.sql` file includes SQL commands to create the animals table with the following columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each animal.
- `name`: The name of the animal.
- `date_of_birth`: The birthdate of the animal.
- `escape_attempts`: The number of escape attempts made by the animal.
- `neutered`: A boolean indicating if the animal is neutered.
- `weight_kg`: The weight of the animal in kilograms.
- `species`: The species of the animal.

You can execute the `schema.sql` file to create the table structure by running:

```
psql -d vet_clinic -a -f schema.sql
```

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured on your machine before running the command.

Feel free to modify the column descriptions and structure according to your project's needs.

Please note that the database schema and structure provided are based on your project's requirements and can be adjusted as necessary.

## 🛠 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The `data.sql` file contains SQL commands to insert sample data into the animals table. You can use these commands to populate the table with information about different animals.

The queries.sql file contains SQL queries to answer various questions about the data stored in the animals table. These queries cover topics like filtering animals based on conditions, retrieving specific information, and calculating aggregate values.

After running the queries, you can take screenshots of the results to showcase your work.

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**How do I set up the PostgreSQL database for this project?**

Clone the repository to your local machine
Create a new PostgreSQL database named "vet_clinic".
Execute the SQL commands in the "schema.sql" file to create the necessary table structure.
Populate the database with sample data by executing the SQL commands in the "data.sql" file.

**How can I run the queries provided in the "queries.sql" file?**

To run the queries provided in the "queries.sql" file, you can use a PostgreSQL client or interface, such as psql command-line tool or a graphical tool like pgAdmin. Connect to your "vet_clinic" database and execute the queries in the file to retrieve the desired information from the database.
